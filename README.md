# Hi, I'm William ðŸ‘‹

I'm a freelance front-end (JAMstack) developer from NorrkÃ¶ping, Sweden ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª. I enjoy working on well-crafted software and try to steadily add value with the projects I work on.

Currently I'm attending a full-stack program at [Integrify](https://www.integrify.io) to further broaden my skills.

You can find me on Twitter at [@WilliamDaghouz](https://twitter.com/WilliamDaghouz)

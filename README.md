# Hi, I'm William 👋

I'm an ex-lawyer turned **software engineer**, based in Norrköping, Sweden. I currently work at **[SwissBorg](https://www.swissborg.com)** as a **Web Developer**.

I have a preference for the **Jamstack** architecture and a predilection of everything related to **Web3**. I'm a strong **accessibility** & **progressive enhancement** advocate.

You can also find me on **[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/daghouz)**.

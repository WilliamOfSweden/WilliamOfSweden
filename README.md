# Hi, I'm William ðŸ‘‹

I'm a lawyer turned software engineer, based in NorrkÃ¶ping, Sweden. I currently work at [Qvantum](https://qvantum.com) as a software developer, where I'm fortunate to contribute to GreenTech projects, focusing on creating sustainable solutions that have a meaningful impact on our environment.

I'm a disciple of [software craftsmanship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship) and an advocate of [web accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accessibility) & [progressive enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement).
